# Hangman Game Challenge - Odin Project

This Hangman game challenge is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It's designed to help **me** apply **my** Ruby programming skills in a fun and interactive way.

## Overview

The Hangman Game Challenge is an engaging project where **I'll** build a command-line Hangman game. **I'll** be facing the computer as the player, but don't worry; **I've** added some advanced features to make it more interesting.

## Game Rules

1. **Word Selection**: When a new game is started, the script load a dictionary and randomly select a word between 5 and 12 characters long as the secret word.

2. **Game Display**: Display the Hangman game, including the number of incorrect guesses remaining, correct letters chosen, and incorrect letters chosen. You don't need to draw a stick figure, but make the game visually informative.

3. **Guessing**: Allow the player to make a case-insensitive guess of a letter every turn. Update the display to show whether the letter was correct or incorrect. The player should lose if they run out of guesses.

4. **Saving and Loading**: Implement the option for the player to save the game's state at the start of any turn. You should also provide the functionality to open saved games, allowing players to continue where they left off.
